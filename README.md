# The story behind this project
When I was first learning web development I wanted to show off the first website I had made to my grandmother so I sent her a link to my site. Later when I asked her what she thought of my site, she responded that it was only one webpage with nothing on it. I thought that this was strange since the website I made had links to various other webpages for the site wich showed off some cool projects I was working on. So upon further investigation I discovered that she did not notice the links to the other webpages on the top of my site. And at that moment I got the inspiration to make a nice-looking UI that wont make it obvious that it is trying to be minimalistic. I planned on making a UI that only asks 1 question and provides a multiple choice answer for said question so people won't be confused by having more then one option at a time.


Here is a link  to a demo of the site: https://rozeraize.github.io/chatsite

WARNING: all the code for this site was vibe-coded but all the prompts, multiple-choice answers, and question were all mine and was not dirtied by any AI slop.
(PS: I hope "dirtied" is a word)
